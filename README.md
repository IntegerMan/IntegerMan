# Hello There ðŸ‘‹

I'm an instructor at [Tech Elevator](https://www.TechElevator.com), a 14 week C#, Java, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Vue.js Bootcamp. I work out of our Columbus, Ohio office and love building things and teaching others to do the same.

Over the last several decades I've worked at a number of software as a service organizations and specialized in .NET and JavaScript technologies. Now my job is to inspire future developers to see what they can do with the technologies available to us today.

I [write](https://www.KillAllDefects.com) and [speak](https://sessionize.com/Matt-Eland) in the technical community and am currently working on [a book](https://NewDevsGuide.com) on application scalability for new developers and non-technical stakeholders.

The best way to get in touch with me is via Twitter at [@IntegerMan](https://www.twitter.com/IntegerMan)

## Writing

I write on software development at [KillAllDefects.com](https://www.KillAllDefects.com) and am writing [The New Developer's Guide to Application Scalability](https://NewDevsGuide.com). 

I'm always happy to entertain requests to write on specific topics, so please [contact me](mailto:Matt@KillAllDefects.com) if you're interested.

## Speaking

I speak frequently at conferences and user groups, and am always interested to share new libraries and projects. See my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/MattEland) for some past talks or [view the full list](https://sessionize.com/Matt-Eland). In addition to this, I also am a co-organizer for the [Central Ohio .NET Developers Group (CONDG)](https://condg.org) in Columbus, OH.
