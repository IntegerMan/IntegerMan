# Hello There ðŸ‘‹

I'm an instructor at [Tech Elevator](https://www.TechElevator.com), a 14 week C#, Java, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Vue.js Bootcamp. I work out of our Columbus, Ohio office and love building things and teaching others to do the same. I'm also a data science master's student at [Franklin University](https://www.franklin.edu/degrees/masters/data-analytics) and anticipate graduation at the end of 2023.

I also create content on data science and machine learning (particularly with Azure and ML.NET) and post it to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MattEland) and my [data science blog](https://AccessibleAI.dev)

The best place to view the full range of my content is by checking out the landing page at [MattEland.dev](https://MattEland.dev).
