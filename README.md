# Hello There ðŸ‘‹

I'm an instructor at [Tech Elevator](https://www.TechElevator.com), a 14 week C#, Java, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Vue.js Bootcamp. I work out of our Columbus, Ohio office and love building things and teaching others to do the same.

Over the last several decades I've worked at a number of software as a service organizations and specialized in .NET and JavaScript technologies. Now my job is to inspire future developers to see what they can do with the technologies available to us today.

# Writing

I write on software development at [KillAllDefects.com](https://www.KillAllDefects.com), though this has lessened as I've focused more of my energies on teaching during my day job. I'm always happy to entertain requests to write on specific topics, so please [contact me](mailto:Matt@KillAllDefects.com) if you're interested.

# Speaking

I speak frequently at conferences and user groups, and am always interested to share new libraries and projects. See my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/MattEland) for some past talks or [view the full list](https://stackoverflow.com/story/matteland). In addition to this, I also am a co-organizer for the Central Ohio .NET Developers Group (CONDG) in Columbus, OH.
